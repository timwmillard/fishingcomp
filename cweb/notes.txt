Generating C code is the future.

generate sql code from schema.sql and queries.sql

geernate api types from spec.yaml

Need to work out memory allocation and using arenas.

First work on system with json parsing and how to pass and arena.

With sqlite generated code, have two version

1. Pass in a pre allocated struct.
2. Dyamically sized (ie array of X) - pass in an arena (same style as oapi2c)
3. Generate a callback style where use populates the struct.
4. Callback will have two version.  Single call back and mutli callback for :many
